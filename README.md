## Overview

This project focuses on the development of **ConcertSaver**, a mobile application designed to provide users with discounted concert tickets. The system aims to simplify the process of finding and purchasing concert tickets at reduced prices, making concerts more accessible and affordable for a wide range of users.

This report was created in collaboration with my teammate, **Charlotte Isabel Busse Mejia**.

## Objective

The primary objectives of this project are to:

- Develop a database system to manage concert-related data efficiently.
- Design and implement user-friendly interfaces through mockups.
- Create detailed and optimized SQL queries for data handling and analysis.
- Present the project with a clear and engaging PowerPoint presentation.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Account creation to access discounts.
- **User Login**: Secure login with optional social media integration.
- **Concert Search**: Search for concerts by keywords, city, venue, or artist, with filtering options.
